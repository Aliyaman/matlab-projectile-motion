## MATLAB projectile motion code

### This code takes angle and speed variables from input and calculates projectile motion.
### And draws a graph.

# Usage

# 1- first.m
* Open file in MATLAB and run the code.
* Enter speed of the ball.
* And program will calculate projectile motion of every angle that is a multiple of ten and draws a graph. 
#### NOTE: The program will open 9 windows so be careful.

# 2- second.m
* Open file in MATLAB and run the code.
* Enter speed and of the ball and angle between ground(Don't use radians).
* And program will calculate projectile motion and draws a graph. 
* Program will point the maximum height.
